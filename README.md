# Email Scraper from Websites ðŸ“§

This script is designed to obtain the emails from different websites in an easy way. You need to have a large list of websites, and the script would check in its contact pages if an email is visible. Then, the data would be passed on a Excel file.

## How to Run It

If you have Python installed yuo can execute the .py file. Otherwise, you can run the .exe file which is in the build folder.

```bash
email_scraper.exe EN
```

```bash
email_scraper.exe ES
```

## Requirements

The used requirements are specified in the requierements.txt file. If you want to execute the .py script from python, you can install the dependencies that way:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
